## 🧩 User Story – AI Task Classifier

**As a** Project Manager,  
**I want** to create, update, and manage my projects and tasks in a smart platform that automatically enriches task information using AI,  
**so that** I can focus more on planning and coordination instead of writing long descriptions or manual estimations.

</p>

### 💡 Acceptance Criteria

- I can register, log in, and access my list of projects and tasks.  
- I can create, edit, delete, or update the status of any project or task.  
- When I add or modify a task, the system automatically enhances it — using AI — with a clear description and estimated story points.  
- The platform keeps all project information organized and easy to review.  
- I can optionally generate a concise AI-based project summary to get an overview of progress.

## 🧩 Component Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the **planned system architecture**, including the frontend, backend, AI components, and database layer.

</p>

> 💡 **Key Insight:**  
> The architecture is modular — separating the AI enrichment logic from core CRUD operations, while maintaining clear communication channels between the frontend, backend, and databases.

## 🗄️ Database Schema (Planned)

The database schema defines the relational structure for **users (PMs)**, **projects**, and **tasks**, supporting AI-enriched fields and RAG integration.

> 🧠 **Tech Stack:**  
> - **Supabase** — Relational DB for structured data  
> - **ChromaDB** — Vector store for embeddings and RAG context

## ⚙️ Core Workflows

### 🧾 Project Creation Flow

This diagram shows how a **Project Manager (PM)** creates a new project via the frontend, which is then processed and stored by the backend.

</p>

### 🪄 Task Creation Flow

> ⚠️ **Important:**  
> A project **must exist** before creating tasks under it.

Once a task is created, it’s asynchronously enriched by the AI model (e.g., story points, details), then stored in the database.

## 🧱 System Summary

| Layer | Description | Tech |
|-------|--------------|------|
| **Frontend** | Handles user interactions (login, project/task creation) | React + Tailwind CSS |
| **Backend** | API layer managing async operations, AI calls, and DB sync | FastAPI |
| **AI Components** | Task enrichment and story point estimation | Custom model + RAG |
| **Databases** | Relational + Vector storage | Supabase & ChromaDB |

---

## 🧩 Design Highlights

- 🔐 **Authentication:** Managed via Supabase Auth  
- ⚡ **Async Operations:** Background AI enrichment handled via async tasks  
- 🧠 **AI Integration:** Context retrieval + enrichment using RAG pipeline  
- 🗃️ **Storage Split:** Relational data in Supabase, embeddings in ChromaDB  
- 🧰 **Scalability:** Modular and easily extendable architecture
